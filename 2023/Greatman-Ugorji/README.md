## Introduction

Hi everyone. My name is Rykerâ€”a front-end developer and technical based in Nigeria. I work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Tailwind, etc. I wish to contribute to the _Wagtail Accessibility documentation_ due to my love and passion for writing and breaking down complex concepts into a simple and easy-to-follow format. I use Hasnode to blog about what I've learned and also help other people get up to speed with complex web development concepts and projects.

This is my first Open Source contribution. Participating in Outreachy will further widen my scope and understanding of key elements and standard practices needed to succeed in Open Source contribution including what it takes to succeed when working for a tech company. Also, this internship will help me harness my knowledge of Git and GitHub in making Open Source contributions and collaboration. I also wish to learn and help others where necessary.

When I'm not working, I love to take a walk to increase my daily step count ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š, I also do anaerobic exercise most times to brush off the stress of a sedentary lifestyle. I hope for a thrilling experience that will positively transform my tech career.
